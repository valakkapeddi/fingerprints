This dir contains 2700 demonstration fingerprint images.  They are
files s0024301.wsq through s0027000.wsq from NIST Special Database 14.
Each image depicts one box of a standard fingerprint card.  The images
are 8-bit grayscale rasters, compressed using an implementation of
Wavelet Scalar Quantization (WSQ). NOTE: The old WSQ code used on
SD14 will not work with a certified WSQ decoder, so the data format of
these images has been converted to the data format of the WSQ
specification so that a certified decoder can be used to read
these images.  The images will still have more data loss than
allowed by the WSQ spec because the images were compressed with
a non-certified WSQ compressor.
