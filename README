This Test directory is organized hierarchically as illustrated in Figure 1 in 
the /NBIS/Main/doc/refs/nbis.pdf.  The utilites are organized by packages 
within the Test directory, one subdirectory for each package.  Within each 
package, there are two directories.  The data directory contains sample input 
files for the utilities in the package.  The execs directory contains one 
subdirectory for each utility in the package.  Within each utility subdirectory
under execs, there is a simple bash shell script (with extension "sh") and example 
output files produced by the script. There is also a "master_test.sh which will 
execute all the NBIS utility. (Note: Running "master_test.sh" may take several
hours.)  

In order to execute the bash shell scripts under Test directory, the
following environment variables are required:

TARGET_INSTALLATION_BIN_DIR=<target installation directory>/bin
TARGET_INSTALLATION_RUNTIME_DIR=<target installation directory>/NBIS/Main/nbis
NBIS_TEST_DIR=<test directory>/NBIS/Test

The <target installation directory> is the specific directory path where you 
installed the NBIS utilities directory and the runtime nibs data directory.  
The <test directory> is the specific directory path where you installed the 
test directory.

On Windows platforms, find.exe is required to run master_test.sh.  To install:

Step 1:
	Complete the steps to install MinGW and MSYS per the Windows installation
	file included with the latest release of the NBIS source distribution.

Step 2:
	Open an MSYS window and type: mingw-get install msys-findutils
	This installs find, oldfind, and xargs.exe into <MinGW install dir>\msys\1.0\bin
	where <MinGW install dir> is the specific directory path where
	you installed MinGW.

Step 3:
	Using any file archiver app, open <MinGW install dir>\var\cache\mingw-get\packages\
	findutils-4.4.2-2-msys-1.0.13-bin.tar.lzma\findutils-4.4.2-2-msys-1.0.13-bin.tar\bin\
	and extract all into <MSYS install dir>\bin\
	where <MSYS install dir> is the specific directory path where
	you installed msys.
